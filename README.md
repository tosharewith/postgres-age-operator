# Production-Ready Graph Database on Kubernetes

The **PostgreSQL AGE Operator** brings the power of [Apache AGE](https://age.apache.org/) (A Graph Extension) to Kubernetes, providing a **declarative graph database** solution that automatically manages your [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) clusters with native graph capabilities.

Based on the proven architecture of the Crunchy Data PostgreSQL Operator, this operator extends PostgreSQL with Apache AGE to deliver enterprise-grade graph database functionality with the reliability and features you expect from PostgreSQL.

## What is Apache AGE?

[Apache AGE](https://age.apache.org/) is an extension for PostgreSQL that provides graph database functionality. It allows you to:
- Store and query graph data using Cypher query language
- Combine SQL and Cypher in the same query
- Leverage PostgreSQL's reliability, ACID compliance, and ecosystem
- Build modern applications with relationships at their core

## Why PostgreSQL AGE Operator?

This operator makes it easy to deploy and manage PostgreSQL clusters with AGE on Kubernetes, providing:

âœ… **Graph + Relational**: Best of both worlds - graph queries with Cypher, relational queries with SQL  
âœ… **Cloud Native**: Designed for Kubernetes from the ground up  
âœ… **High Availability**: Automatic failover and replica management  
âœ… **Production Ready**: Based on battle-tested Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator  
âœ… **GitOps Friendly**: Declarative configuration for your entire database stack

## Quick Start

Get a graph database running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gregoriomomm/postgres-age-operator
cd postgres-age-operator

# Build the AGE-enabled image
docker build -f Dockerfile.age -t localhost/postgres-age-patroni .

# For Kind clusters: Load the image
kind load docker-image localhost/postgres-age-patroni

# Deploy the operator
kubectl apply --server-side -k config/default

# Create an AGE cluster
kubectl apply -k examples/age-cluster/

# Connect and start using graphs!
kubectl exec -it -n postgres-operator \
  $(kubectl get pod -n postgres-operator -l postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/role=master -o name) \
  -c database -- psql
```  

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Graph Database Capabilities

- **Cypher Query Language**: Industry-standard graph query language
- **Hybrid Queries**: Combine SQL and Cypher in the same query
- **Graph Algorithms**: Built-in support for common graph algorithms
- **Visual Data Modeling**: Natural representation of connected data

### ðŸš€ Enterprise Features

#### PostgreSQL Cluster [Provisioning][provisioning]

[Create, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease][provisioning], while fully customizing your
Pods and PostgreSQL configuration!

#### [High Availability][high-availability]

Safe, automated failover backed by a [distributed consensus high availability solution][high-availability].
Uses [Pod Anti-Affinity][k8s-anti-affinity] to help resiliency; you can configure how aggressive this can be!
Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time.

Support for [standby PostgreSQL clusters][multiple-cluster] that work both within and across [multiple Kubernetes clusters][multiple-cluster].

#### [Disaster Recovery][disaster-recovery]

[Backups][backups] and [restores][disaster-recovery] leverage the open source [pgBackRest][] utility and
[includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta restores][backups].
Set how long you to retain your backups. Works great with very large databases!

#### Security and [TLS][tls]

PGO enforces that all connections are over [TLS][tls]. You can also [bring your own TLS infrastructure][tls] if you do not want to use the defaults provided by PGO.

PGO runs containers with locked-down settings and provides Postgres credentials in a secure, convenient way for connecting your applications to your data.

#### [Monitoring][monitoring]

[Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters][monitoring] using the open source [pgMonitor][] library.

#### [Upgrade Management][update-postgres]

Safely [apply PostgreSQL updates][update-postgres] with minimal impact to the availability of your PostgreSQL clusters.

#### Advanced Replication Support

Choose between [asynchronous][high-availability] and synchronous replication
for workloads that are sensitive to losing transactions.

#### [Clone][clone]

[Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups][clone] with efficient data cloning.

#### [Connection Pooling][pool]

Advanced [connection pooling][pool] support using [pgBouncer][].

#### Pod Anti-Affinity, Node Affinity, Pod Tolerations

Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to [Kubernetes Nodes][k8s-nodes] of your preference. Set your [pod anti-affinity][k8s-anti-affinity], node affinity, Pod tolerations, and more rules to customize your deployment topology!

#### [Scheduled Backups][backup-management]

Choose the type of backup (full, incremental, differential) and [how frequently you want it to occur][backup-management] on each PostgreSQL cluster.

#### Backup to Local Storage, [S3][backups-s3], [GCS][backups-gcs], [Azure][backups-azure], or a Combo!

[Store your backups in Amazon S3][backups-s3] or any object storage system that supports
the S3 protocol. You can also store backups in [Google Cloud Storage][backups-gcs] and [Azure Blob Storage][backups-azure].

You can also [mix-and-match][backups-multi]: PGO lets you [store backups in multiple locations][backups-multi].

#### [Full Customizability][customize-cluster]

PGO makes it easy to fully customize your Postgres cluster to tailor to your workload:

- Choose the resources for your Postgres cluster: [container resources and storage size][resize-cluster]. [Resize at any time][resize-cluster] with minimal disruption.
- - Use your own container image repository, including support `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories
- [Customize your PostgreSQL configuration][customize-cluster]

#### [Namespaces][k8s-namespaces]

Deploy PGO to watch Postgres clusters in all of your [namespaces][k8s-namespaces], or [restrict which namespaces][single-namespace] you want PGO to manage Postgres clusters in!
